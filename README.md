### APUSH Textbook
---
A website I built to host pdf scans of the textbook for my AP US History class. 

Ultimately taken down to avoid legal action ðŸ˜…. I was too lazy to learn backend or any sql db, so I built a JS-JSON lookup function from scratch. 

I stand by my decision not to learn backend. I hate web development.
